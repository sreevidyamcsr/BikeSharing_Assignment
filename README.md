## General Information
- This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes in the American market.
- Background: BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced dips in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They seek to understand the factors affecting bike demand to prepare for post-pandemic recovery.
- Business Problem: Understanding the significant variables influencing bike demand and predicting future demand to optimize business strategy and meet customer needs.
- Dataset: The dataset includes daily bike rental data with features such as weather conditions, season, and user information.

## Conclusions
> Model Performance:

1. The R-squared value on the training set is 0.81, indicating that 81% of the variability in the bike rental data is explained by the model. This high R-squared value suggests that the model fits the training data well.
2. The R-squared value on the test set is 0.79, which is very close to the training set's R-squared. This consistency suggests that the model generalizes well to unseen data and is not overfitting.

> Error Analysis:

1. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the training set is 850.91, and on the test set, it is 860.50. These similar RMSE values indicate that the model's predictions are relatively accurate and that it performs consistently on both training and test data.

> Conclusion
1. The model demonstrates strong predictive performance with high R-squared values and low RMSE on both training and test sets.
2. The consistency between training and test performance indicates a well-fitted model with good generalization capabilities, making it reliable for predicting bike rentals based on the selected features.
